# Write code inside the functions
# You will have to figure out what parameters to include
# 🚨 All functions must use recursion 🚨

# Write a function that accepts a complex dictionary and prints out all of it's keys and all of its values. 
# The dictionary can have dictionaries nested inside of it
# 'dictionary' is the dictionary that's currently being iterated over.
# 'indent' is a string representing the current level of indentation
# ...
# pretty_print(inner_dictionary, indent + '..');

    # Write code here
